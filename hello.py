I was in 6th grade when my father brought Mario home when he was just 45 days old. His cute little face was so fluffy I could just hug and kiss him all day. I bought a soccer ball, with which he and I used to play all day long. Being in school, I used to think about what is he doing right now or today I’ll take him for a walk to the park, where we will play soccer, etc.His unconditional love has always been there as a stress reliever. His loyalty, unwavering support and companionship have been with me in my good and bad times. Now that he is an adult, I have taken all his responsibilities like feeding him, bathing him, taking him for walks, etc.Mario once fell ill due to a cold, and whatever he was eating, he was not able to digest it. I got s worried that I took him to the vet, where he was given a penicillin shot as an antibiotic treatment. I was so scared that I held him with my hands and he was lying there, unconscious. Two hours later, he gained his consciousness and started licking my face. All my sorrow and sadness vanished away in a second, seeing his beautiful eyes and fluffy tail wavering all over the table.</br></div>"
